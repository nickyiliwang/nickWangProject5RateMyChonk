get mui installed

this is a mobile first app.

get redux setup

basic flow is:

mobile

sign page without any auth
Continue as guest main
get firebase auth working or
signup

go to chonder page, maybe have an welcome flow

user interacts with how ever many pictures of cats, they can vote, favorite(has an info about only registered users can save chonks), and 

this is an infinite loop until someone breaks it, by either taping out of the app, out of the chonder page or disconnects

not prio: maybe they can have an default user Profile with name of guest, and current favorites, once they register, they can even upload pictures. that means the upload component will be nested in the user profile page.

main object:

make the chonder page the main focus,
